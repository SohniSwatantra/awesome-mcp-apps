A curated list of awesome applications, UI components, and resources for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) APPS **.

> **The centralized directory of top MCPApps.** Maintaining the standard for Model Context Protocol applications and ecosystem.

## What are MCPApps?

**MCPApps** are the applications and interfaces that bring the Model Context Protocol to life for end-users. 

While **MCP Servers** act as the backend "plugins" that expose data and tools, **MCPApps** are the frontend experiences—such as Desktop Agents, IDEs, and specialized workflows—that consume these servers to provide context-aware intelligence.

This list captures both the **Applications** and the **UI Components** (MCPApps UI) used to build them.

MCP-UI now standardized as MCPAPPS- Read more about MCP-UI here- https://mcpui.dev/

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with your data and tools. It provides a universal way to connect AI assistants to systems like databases, tailored APIs, and business applications.
